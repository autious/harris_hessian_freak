 * This file contains C code to convert between IEEE double, single, and half
 * precision floating point formats. The intended use is for standalone C code
 * that does not rely on MATLAB mex.h. The bit pattern for the half precision
 * floating point format is stored in a 16-bit unsigned int variable. The half
 * precision bit pattern definition is:
 *
 * 1 bit sign bit
 * 5 bits exponent, biased by 15
 * 10 bits mantissa, hidden leading bit, normalized to 1.0
 *
 * Special floating point bit patterns recognized and supported:
 *
 * All exponent bits zero:
 * - If all mantissa bits are zero, then number is zero (possibly signed)
 * - Otherwise, number is a denormalized bit pattern
 *
 * All exponent bits set to 1:
 * - If all mantissa bits are zero, then number is +Infinity or -Infinity
 * - Otherwise, number is NaN (Not a Number)
 *
 * For the denormalized cases, note that 2^(-24) is the smallest number that can
 * be represented in half precision exactly. 2^(-25) will convert to 2^(-24)
 * because of the rounding algorithm used, and 2^(-26) is too small and underflows
 * to zero.
